# Lojinha - by JCranky

Lojinha is a small application for a personal auction site. It is developed using the Play! Framework 2 and should be deployable anywhere a play application can run.

Before deploying, remember to configure your database and your amazon aws credentials in the application.conf file - or to add a secret.conf with the credentials.

You can see Lojinha in production here: http://lojinha.jcranky.com/ and some development videos with this project in this youtube channel:
